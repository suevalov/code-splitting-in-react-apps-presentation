# Code-Splitting in React apps

The talk for [**React Poznan** Meeting](https://www.meetup.com/React-Poznan/events/240294658/).

## Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running `npm run build`

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run `npm run deploy`

## To Present

* Run `npm start`
* Open two browser windows on two different screens
* On your screen open http:/localhost:3000/?presenter
* On the presentation screen visit http://localhost:3000

You can toggle the presenter or overview mode by pressing `atl + p` or `alt + o`.
